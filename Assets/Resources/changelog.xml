        <Version number="0.5.1" addon="a0" title="The UI Rework">
            <Text>With this update a lot of changes to the main menu and the UI system have been implemented. A clear design language was chosen and a dark color theme was added. Behind the scenes the application can support more than just one color theme, so different ones might be added later.\nThe UI components were reworked and will be able to support upcoming features.</Text>
